django-condor
=============

This is a small django app designed to ease the integration of the condor high performance
computing job submission system and django based websites.

Requires
--------

django and python, but also paramiko - but only if you need to connect to remote job
scheduling machines (roll your own ssh seems a little flaky).

Install
-------

This should be as simple as `python setup.py install`

You will need to ensure that 'condor' has been included in you INSTALLED_APPS in
settings.py Remeber to run `python manage.py syncdb' to create the correct DB entries.

Usage
-----

You will likely need to set some environment variables in order to communicate with the
condor instance on your submit node. Setting non-django environment variables from django
isn't very pleasant so django-condor provides a mechanism for you to do this - see
`GRID_ENV` in settings.py

For debugging, the entire django-condor DB can be dropped with
`python manage.py reset condor`
